Web application - ShoesShop

In this project I have used several technologies and they are: html css jQuery and java script.
 First I made an html page in which I imported the JQuery library, CSS ,FontAwsome and  Java script.
 First we have a header in which I put the navigation. Then I put a DIV in which there is a hero wrapper in which there is a tag that takes us to the product section, using jQuery to animate h2 and smooth scrolling from the hero wrapper to the section with products.
 The products are located in three separate DIV, which are in one section
Products card can make active the color that is selected with the Java script code, which is in index.js
